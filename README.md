# Professional Portfolio

Using React and various react ui components, I created a personal portfolio that tells the world about who I am, presents a Portfolio of my work that allows a visitor to view what I've accomplished, allows a visitor to contact me and, lastly, review my resume while downloading a pdf copy as well.

## About me

This would be a strong equivalent of a cover letter should I provide one.  It tells the visitor a little about me and highlights both my "tangible" and also my intangible skills.

## Portfolio

Here we give the visitor the opportunity to review some of my past work while also allowing them the opportunity to visit the live links of that work to "touch" them and also provide a link to allow them to visit the code bases.

Here is the link to it:  https://macktrain.github.io/sandlot-week20/

## Contact

If a visitor would like to contact me, then can use the contact form (which still needs a "mailto" added to it) or reach out to me via one of the methods provided on the page:  email or phone call (Text is best).

## Resume

Lastly, we provide my current resume online and then allow the user a link to download a pdf version of my resume

## Technology Used

React js was leveraged along with React Material-ui

## Future Development

*  Clean up the actual resume content to reflect a developer role
*  Add the "mailto" in the contact form.
